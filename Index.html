					<h2>What is Sustainability?</h2>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.epa.gov/sustainability/basicinfo.htm">Sustainability is based on a simple principle: Everything that we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainability creates and maintains the conditions under which humans and nature can EXIST in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.
						</blockquote>
					<h3>What is Sustainable Agriculture?</h3>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/conflict-prevention/avoiding-collisions-with.html">Agriculture has changed dramatically, especially since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity soared due to new technologies, mechanization, increased chemical use, specialization and government policies that favored maximizing production. These changes allowed fewer farmers with reduced labor demands to produce the majority of the food and fiber in the U.S.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/conflict-prevention/avoiding-collisions-with.html">Although these changes have had many positive effects and reduced many risks in farming, there have also been significant costs.Prominent among these are topsoil depletion, groundwater contamination, the decline of family farms, continued neglect of the living and working conditions for farm laborers, increasing costs of production, and the disintegration of economic and social conditions in rural communities.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/conflict-prevention/avoiding-collisions-with.html">A growing movement has emerged during the past two decades to question the role of the agricultural establishment in promoting practices that contribute to these social problems. Today this movement for sustainable agriculture is garnering increasing support and acceptance within mainstream agriculture. Not only does sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social concerns, but it offers innovative and economically viable opportunities for growers, laborers, consumers, policymakers and many others in the entire food system.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote cite="http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/conflict-prevention/avoiding-collisions-with.html">This paper is an effort to identify the ideas, practices and policies that constitute our concept of sustainable agriculture. We do so for two reasons: 1) to clarify the research agenda and priorities of our program, and 2) to suggest to others practical steps that may be appropriate for them in moving toward sustainable agriculture.Because the concept of sustainable agriculture is still evolving, we intend the paper not as a definitive or final statement, but as an invitation to continue the dialogue.
